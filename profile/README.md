❍❍❍ TV 𝐅𝐢𝐥𝐦 ❍❍❍

The first television shows were experimental, sporadic programs that from the 1930s could only be seen at a very short distance from the mast. TV events such as the 1936 Summer Olympics in Germany, the crowning of King George VI. In Br𝐈𝐓𝐀in in 1930 and the famous launch of David Sarnoff at the 1939 New York World’s Fair in the United States, the medium grew, but World War II brought development to a halt after the war. The 190 World MOVIE inspired many Americans to buy their first television, and in 198 the popular Texaco Star Theater radio moved to become the first weekly television variety show that hosted Milton Berle and earned the name “Mr Television” demonstrated The medium was a stable, modern form of entertainment that could attract advertisers. The first national live television broadcast in the United States took place on September , 1951, when President Harry Truman’s speech at the Japanese Peace Treaty Conference in San Francisco on AT & T’s transcontinental cable and microwave relay system was broadcasting to broadcasters in local markets has been. The first national color show (the 195 Rose Parade tournament) in the United States took place on January 1, 195. For the next ten years, most network broadcasts and almost all local broadcasts continued to be broadcast in black and white. A color transition was announced for autumn 1965, in which more than half of all network prime time programs were broadcast in color. The first all-color peak season came just a year later. In 1902, the last holdout of daytime network shows was converted to the first full color network season.

❍❍❍ formats and genres ❍❍❍

See also: List of genres § 𝐅𝐢𝐥𝐦 and television formats and genres

TV shows are more diverse than most other media due to the variety of formats and genres that can be presented. A show can be fictional (as in comedies and dramas) or non-fictional (as in documentary, news, and reality television). It can be current (as in the case of a local news program and some television 𝐅𝐢𝐥𝐦s) or historical (as in the case of many documentaries and fictional 𝐅𝐢𝐥𝐦s). They can be educational or educational in the first place, or entertaining, as is the case with situation comedies and game shows. [C𝐈𝐓𝐀tion required] A drama program usually consists of a series of actors who play characters in a historical or contemporary setting. The program follows their lives and adventures. Before the 1980s, shows (with the exception of soap opera series) generally remained static without storylines, and the main characters and premise barely changed. [C𝐈𝐓𝐀tion required] If the characters’ lives changed a bit during the episode, it was usually reversed in the end. For this reason, the episodes can be broadcast in any order. [C𝐈𝐓𝐀tion required] Since the 1980s, many 𝐅𝐢𝐥𝐦S have had a progressive change in the plot, characters, or both. For example, Hill Street Blues and St. Elsewhere were two of the first American prime time drama television 𝐅𝐢𝐥𝐦s to have this kind of dramatic structure [] [better source required], while the later MOVIE Immaculate - La prescelta - Immaculate - La prescelta - 5 further illustrated such a structure had a predetermined story about the planned five season run. [C𝐈𝐓𝐀tion required] In 2020, it was reported that television became a larger part of the revenue of large media companies than the 𝐅𝐢𝐥𝐦. Some also noticed the quality improvement of some television programs. In 2020, Oscar-winning 𝐅𝐢𝐥𝐦 director Steven Soderbergh declared the ambiguity and complexity of character and narrative: “ think these qualities are now being seen on television and people who want to see stories with such qualities are watching TV.
